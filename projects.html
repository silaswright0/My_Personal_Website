The project demonstrates a solid understanding of procedural programming and the C language.</p>

I worked with my client to carefully design a modular project structure using agile methodology to allow for seamless integration of new features. My client sets clear project requirements that I satisfy within specified time constraints. I maintained proactive communication with the client to deliver project components and actively engaged in discussions to identify and implement improvements.

Moreover, teaching myself how to create this website is a demonstration of my hard working nature, initiative, and problem solving capabilities. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a visually appealing, interactive website.
